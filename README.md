# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this guide to help me prepare for a coding bootcamp and to better understand the basics of coding.  This guide allowed me to use what I was learning and provides a place where I can look back for a refresher.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
